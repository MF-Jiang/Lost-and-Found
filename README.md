# Lost and Found

## Project Overview
Lost&Found is a creation by Stool Dragon Studio, a team composed of students and alumni from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. As newcomers to the G-Byte Game Jam, our team displayed great enthusiasm and dedication in completing all phases of the competition. After 30 hours of planning and development, we proudly present our creation, "Lost&Found"!

## Design Concept
Absorption is defined as an object taking external substances into itself. Our inspiration comes from the classic game "Snake," where the snake grows by continuously "eating" blocks, but it must balance its size and movement. We aimed to design a game that requires both strategy and skill. In "Lost&Found," players need to consider not only absorbing "external substances" but also decide when to discard what they've absorbed to overcome obstacles and absorb the right elements to progress. Thus, we chose to create a puzzle game with mazes as the core and items as auxiliary elements.

## Game Introduction
### Character Profile
In "Lost&Found," the character Bench is an adorable little slime. Due to the collapse of the world, Bench initially sees a monotonous, colorless world. With each level Bench completes, he gains a color, each representing a characteristic - red for strength, yellow for resilience, and blue for wisdom. As Bench successfully completes all levels, he collects various elements, transforming his body into a vibrant, colorful state, attracting companions and moving on to the next stage.

### Level Design
We've designed five unique levels for the game. The first level serves as an introduction, where Bench navigates a series of challenging mazes filled with puzzles and obstacles. Bench can increase his size by absorbing energy blocks, and reduce his size by shooting bullets (using the spacebar or left mouse button) to pass through narrow passages. Players must control Bench's movement using the W, A, S, D keys to avoid spikes, cleverly utilize bounce blocks and teleporters, find keys, and progress to the next level.
